        <div class="copy copy-box">
            <p>Every agency will tell you they have a distinct, positive culture. Mostly they don’t. But just ask any industry recruiter and you’ll hear confirmation that BBH is different in this regard. We repeatedly get told that our culture is something which sets BBH apart. And even people who’ve moved on tend still to feel positive about their time here.

            And our culture isn’t only about creativity. Although creativity is central to everything we do and believe. “Good & Nice” is what we expect of everyone who grabs a computer and takes up residence here. No fools, no political schemers, no arrogant bastards. Really. And our logo is the Black Sheep, the one who does things differently and thus stands out. So no blandness either: people come here to do the best work of their career, nothing more and nothing less.

            This year, big initiatives like Griffin Farley Beautiful Minds or the ongoing Barn intern scheme provided further high-profile evidence of the BBH culture in action. But the same thing came to life every day in the smaller aspects of our life and work together – the way all of us are excited by a radically original new idea, the way all of us treat each other with respect, the way all of us rally in a crisis, the way none of us like those horrible dry pinenuts in the bottom of the trail mix packets in the café.

            Have a look at the photos – it’s as nice as it looks.</p>

          <div class="subheading-2 name3 upper"><br><br>Griffin Farley Search for Beautiful Minds</div>
          <div class="copy copy-box">
              <p>Griffin Farley was a Strategy Director at BBH New York who lost his battle to mesothelioma in early 2013.
              The unanimous memory we all have of Griffin is of his generosity in helping those just setting out in their careers. So many junior strategists got their first coaching, their first training, their first career advice, their first ‘Don’t worry, let me explain….’ from Griffin. So to honor Griffin’s commitment to up-and-coming planning talent, BBH created a weekend “bootcamp” for 50 aspiring strategists, with some of the industry’s best strategic leaders stepping up to provide guidance, coaching and support. Senior executives from agencies including BBDO, 360i, Google Creative Lab, McCann Erickson, Goodby Silverstein and Havas all participated as speakers and judges. And hundreds of people attended the final awards evening.

              The result was a resounding success. We had over 160 applicants from around the world and garnered over two million earned media impressions - as well as commitments for future sponsorship from Google and the Association of American Advertising Agencies.

              Perhaps more important than any of this, however, were the words of Griffin’s wife in closing the final evening of the weekend. “Griffin would have been proud” she said, “he’d have loved this”.</p>

          <div class="copy copy-box">
            <p>BBH NY has always championed women in leadership, with Emma Cookson (Chairman), Sarah Watson (Chief Strategy Officer) and Elizabeth Barr (Director of Finance) ‘leaning in’ on a daily basis - and helping support and inspire other women in their evolving career path. As a total, we are 39% female and 61% male.

            We’re also a mixed culture of Caucasian, Black/African American, Hispanic and Asian - with nationals from Canada, the UK, France, Australia, Columbia, Sweden, Ireland and Norway all represented within our relatively small headcount.</p>
